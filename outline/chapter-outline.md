# Chapter Outline: Introduction

## Overall Goal

Introduce the main character and establish the basic premise of the story.

## Plot Points

1. **Inciting Incident**: John accidentally changes time flow
2. **Rising Action**: John experiments with his abilities
3. **Climax**: John realizes consequences of his actions
4. **Falling Action**: John decides how to proceed

## Major Scenes

1. Morning routine (establishes character)
2. Discovery of time manipulation
3. First experiment with time
4. Confrontation with consequences

## Story Beats

- Establish character: 60% of chapter
- Introduce conflict: 20% of chapter
- Build tension: 15% of chapter
- Resolve tension: 5% of chapter

## Key Questions to Address

- What are the rules of time manipulation?
- How does John feel about his abilities?
- What are the consequences of using these powers?

## Notes

This is a setup chapter. I need to make it engaging while not revealing too much.
