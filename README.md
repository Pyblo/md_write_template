# Novel Project

This repository contains all files for my novel writing project.

## Structure

- `chapters/` - Main chapters of the novel
- `characters/` - Character profiles and descriptions
- `scenes/` - Detailed scene breakdowns
- `outline/` - Story outlines and plot structures
- `research/` - World building and reference materials
- `notes/` - Brainstorming and ideas

## Getting Started

1. Open the project (root_folder/) in any valid markdown editor (neovim,vscode,vim,emacs)
2. Navigate to chapters directory to start writing
3. Use markdown formatting for all content
4. Commit changes regularly with descriptive messages

## Writing Guidelines

- Use consistent formatting throughout
- Keep files focused on single topics
- Reference character profiles from the characters/ directory
